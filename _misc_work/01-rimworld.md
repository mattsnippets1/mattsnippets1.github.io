At [Ludeon Studeos](https://ludeon.com/) I'm working on Ludeon's hit indie game RimWorld which is a sci-fi  construction and management sim but first and foremost a story generator. Inspired by Dwarf Fortress, Firefly, and Dune, in RimWorld's distant future you must control a group of colonists surviving a spaceship crash on a distant planet.

The planet, events and all entities of the game are procedurally generated so each playthrough tells a completely different story starring different people. RimWorld is one of the highest-rated Steam games and it has sold more than a million copies worldwide. It has three DLCs so far: Royalty, Ideology and Biotech, each one adding new elements to the gameplay. More content is actively in development.


*Engine: Unity -- Platform: Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, macOS, Linux*
