Hi,  
This is the developer portfolio of mattsnippets (Mate Meszaros). I'm primarily working with Unity and C# but I have experience with C++ and VR/AR/XR also. Feel free to contact me if you have any questions!

The pronunciation of my name might not be obvious, here's a little help:   
[Name recording]({{ site.url }}/assets/download/name.wav) *([ˈmaːteː] [ˈmeːsaːroʃ])*
