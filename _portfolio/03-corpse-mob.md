Corpse Mob was my first game that made it from prototype to shipped version. Apart from the monster graphics and a few stock sfx everything else was created by me (design, programming, music, sfx, vfx). It's a fast paced old-school top down shooter with local co-op and some RPG mechanics. It was published on Steam for several years but has been retired since.
