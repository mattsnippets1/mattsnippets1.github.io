Greendom is the demo of a chill building/farming game where you help little plant-based aliens terraforming a desert planet. It's a hex-based 2D game where you must strategically place farms and expand the terraformed territory while managing resources. Most of the map is hidden beneath a dark shroud and must be explored.

*Engine: Unity -- Platform: Windows*

- Weather system with unique preferences for each plant and dynamic snow

Assets are either freely available, bought from itch.io and Unity asset store or custom made. Special thanks to [Kenney](https://www.kenney.nl/) whose assets I've been using a lot while creating this prototype.
